I am currently getting my BS in CS at [The University of Illinois](https://cs.illinois.edu/). I will be rejoining [Figma](https://www.figma.com/about/) full time as a new grad software engineer. I have previously been a software engineering intern at State Farm and [dscout](https://dscout.com/).

I enjoy taking a deeper look into computer graphics, systems programming, and how we can design more performant, maintable, and legible software.
